                    <h3> Education</h3>
                    <CODE>This is Isabelle when she graduate from kinder garden and she received a two medal.
                  That was a memorable or we say a core memory that is hard to forget. I was so happy to received an award, and my both parents are with me supporting me with or without a medal.

                  The next photo is the grade 6 graduation from her old school. She spent almost 5 years there and she built so much memory with their classmates and teachers. 


                  The third photo is grade 10. This was a pandemic which is an online module. And we were so happy because we were able to meet all the students and the teacher even though there was a pandemic at that time.  
                  And the senior high school year this

                  
                   And the senior high school year is the best memory that she ever had because they do so much activity and she met new friends that she built a 
                   fun and memorable experience in her senior year.

                    <h3>Project & Activities</h3>
                    <CODE> These are some Project & Activities that I made during my 1st year in University of The East as Information Technology (IT) student.
                         The first Activity that I encountered and accomplished was coding a program by using CodeChum. It was not a smooth first activity because I had a low grade but it did not stop me from pursuing Information Technology (IT).
                         It opened myself more to make extra effort and to learn more about coding. This project helped me more understand myself because this activity composes what I'm as a person. </CODE>

                 also currently she loves reading books to expand her vocabulary. These kinds of hobbies and interests of Isabelle take away from her
